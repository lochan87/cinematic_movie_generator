# Cinematic Movie Generator using Generative AI

This project allows users to input text into a web interface, which is then processed by an AI model (Google's Gemini) to generate content based on the input. The backend is built using Flask or FastAPI, and the frontend uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to collect input and display results.

## **Features**
- Frontend: Simple web interface to enter text and submit it to the backend.
- Backend: Flask or FastAPI application that communicates with an AI model API to generate content.
- AI Integration: Uses the Google Generative AI API or OpenAI's GPT to generate content.
